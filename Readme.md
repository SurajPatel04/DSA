## Array Problems

A collection of common array-related problems along with their solutions.

1. **Anagram**: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
2. **Common Element**: Find common elements between two arrays.
3. **Find Unique Element**: Identify the unique element in an array where every other element is repeated.
4. **Maximum Sub Array**: Solve the maximum sum subarray problem (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm).
5. **Pair Sum**: Find pairs in an array whose sum equals a given target.
6. **Swap Adjacent**: Swap adjacent elements in the array.
7. **Three Pair Sum**: Find triplets in an array whose sum equals a given target.
8. **Majority Element**: Find majority Element in an array
9. **BuyAndSell**: Find largest Profit
10. **FindDublicateInt**: There is two ways to solve one is Hash and another is Floyd's Cycle Detection

## Hash Tables

### Hash Building

Learn how to build hash tables from scratch to store key-value pairs efficiently.

### Hash Problems

1. **Find Duplicates**: Identify duplicate elements in an array.
2. **First Non-Repeating Character**: Find the first character in a string that does not repeat.
3. **Two Lists Contain Duplicate**: Check if two lists have any common elements.

## Linked Lists

Implement and solve problems using different types of linked lists.

1. **Singly Linked List**: Basic operations on a singly linked list (insert, delete, search, etc.).
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Operations for a doubly linked list with both forward and backward pointers.
3. **Circular Linked List**: A circularly linked list where the tail points to the head.
4. **Circular Doubly Linked List**: A combination of doubly linked and circular linked lists.

## Search Algorithms

1. **Linear Search**: Traverse the array to find an element.
2. **Binary Search**: Efficiently search a sorted array by dividing the search space in half.

### Search Problems

Solve common search-related problems with optimized approaches:
- **Find Total Occurrence**: Find the total number of occurrences of an element in a sorted array using binary search.
